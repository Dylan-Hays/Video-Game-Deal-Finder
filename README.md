# üéÆ Video Game Deal Finder

Welcome to **Video Game Deal Finder** ‚Äì a web application that allows you to search for video games and instantly discover where they‚Äôre on sale across multiple stores!

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This capstone project was built for the Code:You web development program. It showcases integration of third-party APIs, frontend dynamic rendering, and a hosted backend proxy for working around CORS and rate-limiting issues. The application fetches data from the RAWG API and CheapShark API to display both game information and deal prices.

---

## üöÄ Features Implemented
This application meets and exceeds the Code:You Capstone requirements:

### Selected Features
- ‚úÖ **Use of Arrays/Objects**: Stores and renders game metadata such as price, ratings, platform support, and release dates.
- ‚úÖ **Analyze Data**: Calculates discounts and displays savings percentages.
- ‚úÖ **Retrieve from Third-Party API**: 
  - [RAWG API](https://rawg.io/apidocs) for game data
  - [CheapShark API](https://apidocs.cheapshark.com/) for live deal prices
- ‚úÖ **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile screens using CSS Flexbox and Media Queries.
- ‚úÖ **Node.js + Express Server**: Serves the frontend and acts as a proxy to secure API keys.

---

## üìñ How It Works
- Type a game title into the search bar.
- Results are fetched from RAWG, then matched with CheapShark's pricing.
- Users can view discount %, old/new prices, ratings, and supported platforms.
- If a sale is found, a green discount tag is shown and users can click the store name to go directly to the storefront.

## üí° Technologies Used
- HTML5, CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Node.js + Express (backend proxy)
- RAWG API, CheapShark API
- Render.com for deployment
